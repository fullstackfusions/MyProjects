# Run Numbers:

If I have some amount and if I invest them in stock at 25% interest for 20 years, then if I have a some other amount which I borrowed at 6.5% interest rate for 20 years, then what would be the total amount in each section (earnings and borrowing sections)?

To calculate the final amounts for both the investment and the loan after 20 years, we can use the following formulas:

### 1. Investment Section:

We use the compound interest formula to calculate the final amount from your investment:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:

- \(A\) is the amount of money after interest.
- \(P\) is the principal or initial investment.
- \(r\) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal).
- \(n\) is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.
- \(t\) is the number of years.

Assuming interest is compounded annually, the formula becomes:

\[
A = P \left(1 + r\right)^t
\]

For 25% interest over 20 years:
\[
A = P \left(1 + 0.25\right)^{20}
\]

### 2. Borrowing Section:

For the loan, we can use the same compound interest formula to calculate the amount you owe after 20 years:

\[
A = P \left(1 + r\right)^t
\]

For 6.5% interest over 20 years:
\[
A = P \left(1 + 0.065\right)^{20}
\]

### 3. Principal amount would be 800000, for example:

After 20 years:

- The total amount from the investment at 25% interest would be approximately **69,388,939**.
- The total amount owed on the loan at 6.5% interest would be approximately **2,818,916**.

These calculations give a clear understanding of how the investment and loan amounts grow over time.
