Below is a concise, step-by-step roadmap that aligns Paul Iusztin’s “Complete AI & LLM Engineering Roadmap” with the free, open-source **Second Brain AI Assistant** course. For each phase you’ll see:

1. **What to learn** (from the roadmap blog)
2. **Where to read** (from course article)
3. **What to run** (from course github)

---

1. **Get the Big Picture**

   * **What:** Understand the end-to-end architecture of a production-ready LLM/RAG system and the “Second Brain” concept.
   * **Read:** [Modules Overview](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/from-0-to-pro-ai-engineering-roadmap)


2. **System Architecture & Agentic RAG Foundations**

   * **What:** Dive into Lesson 1 to see how all the pieces (data pipelines, vector store, agents, inference & observability) fit together.
   * **Read:** [Build your Second Brain AI assistant (Lesson 1)](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/build-your-second-brain-ai-assistant)
   * **Code:** No code—this is purely design & intuition.
   * **Description:** Architect an AI assistant for your Second Brain.

3. **Data Collection & ETL Pipelines**

   * **What:** Learn to ingest Notion (or static) documents, crawl linked resources, compute quality scores, and load everything into MongoDB.
   * **Read:** [Data pipelines for AI assistants (Lesson 2)](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/data-pipelines-for-ai-assistants)
   * **Code:** `apps/second-brain-offline` → the **ETL** folder ([…/apps/second-brain-offline](https://github.com/decodingml/second-brain-ai-assistant-course/tree/main/apps/second-brain-offline))
   * **Description:** Build a data ETL pipeline to process custom Notion data, crawl documents, compute a quality score using LLMs & heuristics, and ingest them into a document database.

4. **Dataset Generation & Distillation**

   * **What:** Turn noisy, heterogeneous docs into a clean “summarization instruct” dataset via distillation loops and filtering.
   * **Read:** [From noisy docs to fine-tuning datasets (Lesson 3)](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/from-noisy-docs-to-fine-tuning-datasets)
   * **Code:** `apps/second-brain-offline` → the **dataset\_generation** scripts. ([…/apps/second-brain-offline](https://github.com/decodingml/second-brain-ai-assistant-course/tree/main/apps/second-brain-offline))
   * **Description:** Use the Notion and crawled data to generate a high-quality summarization instruct dataset using distillation.

5. **Fine-Tune & Deploy Your Own LLM**

   * **What:** Learn to format the dataset, apply QLoRA, run experiments with Comet, evaluate, tweak, and push a fine-tuned model.
   * **Read:** [Playbook to fine-tune and deploy LLMs (Lesson 4)](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/playbook-to-fine-tune-and-deploy)
   * **Code:** `apps/second-brain-offline` → the **fine\_tuning** folder. ([…/apps/second-brain-offline](https://github.com/decodingml/second-brain-ai-assistant-course/tree/main/apps/second-brain-offline))
   * **Description:** Fine-tune an open-source LLM (Llama 3.1 8B) to specialize in summarizing documents. Deploy it as a real-time API endpoint.

6. **Build Robust RAG Feature Pipelines**

   * **What:** Architect chunking, contextual & parent retrieval, embedding, storing & indexing so that your assistant always pulls the right context.
   * **Read:** [Build RAG pipelines that actually work (Lesson 5)](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/build-rag-pipelines-that-actually)
   * **Code:** `apps/second-brain-offline` → the **rag\_feature\_pipeline** code. ([…/apps/second-brain-offline](https://github.com/decodingml/second-brain-ai-assistant-course/tree/main/apps/second-brain-offline))
   * **Description:** Implement a modular RAG feature pipeline using advanced techniques such as context and parent retrieval.

7. **Agentic Inference & LLMOps in Production**

   * **What:** Wrap your RAG engine in an agent layer (LiteLLM), hook up summarizer & retriever tools, and build an observability pipeline (prompt traces, LLM-as-judge) with Opik.
   * **Read:** [LLMOps for production agentic RAG (Lesson 6)](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/llmops-for-production-agentic-rag)
   * **Code:** `apps/second-brain-online` → the **inference** module. ([…/apps/second-brain-offline](https://github.com/decodingml/second-brain-ai-assistant-course/tree/main/apps/second-brain-online))
   * **Description:** Implement the RAG agentic inference pipeline and an observation pipeline to monitor and evaluate the performance of the AI assistant.
