## Start Here

This is a step-by-step path I would take as a DevOps professional and educator if I were starting from zero again. It shows the most efficient path to become a DevOps engineer, tailored based on your background (systems administrator, software developer, test automation engineer, network engineer, or someone with little to no IT knowledge).

> **Note:** DevOps covers the entire software development lifecycle and is constantly evolving. Be prepared to keep learning new tools and concepts even after becoming a DevOps engineer.

## DevOps Roadmap

### 01 – Concepts of Software Development

As a DevOps engineer, you don’t write the application code, but you collaborate with development teams to automate and streamline their workflows. You should understand:

* Software development lifecycle (from idea to release)
* Agile methodologies and Jira workflows
* Git workflows used by developers
* Build and packaging tools
* Automated testing scopes

Additionally, know the networking and security basics to configure infrastructure:

* Firewalls, IP addressing, ports, and DNS
* Load balancers, proxies
* HTTP/HTTPS configuration

And the fundamentals of server administration:

* Operating system concepts (primarily Linux)
* Installing software and managing servers

### 02 – OS & Linux Basics

Key skills:

* Shell commands and scripting
* Linux file system and permissions
* SSH key management
* Virtualization fundamentals

*(You don’t need advanced SysAdmin expertise; basic command-line proficiency suffices.)*

### 03 – Containerization – Docker

Containers virtualize the application layer of the OS, offering lightweight, consistent environments. With Docker, learn to:

* Run and inspect containers
* Manage Docker networking and volumes
* Write Dockerfiles and multi-stage builds
* Orchestrate multi-container setups with Docker Compose
* Push and pull images from registries

### 04 – CI/CD Pipelines

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) is the heart of DevOps. A typical pipeline:

1. Trigger on code change (e.g., Git push)
2. Run automated tests
3. Package the application
4. Build a container image
5. Push the image to a registry
6. Deploy to servers or clusters

**Skills to master:**

* Setting up CI/CD servers (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, etc.)
* Integrating repositories to trigger pipelines
* Using build tools and test runners
* Configuring artifact repositories (Nexus, Artifactory)
* Deploying across environments (cloud, Kubernetes)

### 05 – Learn One Cloud Provider

Focus on a major IaaS platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP):

* AWS examples:

  * IAM (identity and permissions)
  * VPC (networking)
  * EC2 (compute)
* Understand platform-specific services for backup, load balancing, etc.

Once proficient, learning additional clouds becomes easier.

### 06 – Container Orchestration – Kubernetes

Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and management of containers. Learn to:

* Understand Kubernetes architecture (pods, deployments, services)
* Use `kubectl` for CLI operations
* Manage ConfigMaps, Secrets, and StatefulSets
* Configure Ingress, networking, and storage volumes
* Work with namespaces and RBAC

Managed offerings (EKS, AKS, GKE) are a good starting point.

### 07 – Monitoring & Observability

Implement monitoring and logging to maintain production reliability:

* **Monitoring:** Prometheus, CloudWatch
* **Visualization:** Grafana
* **Logging:** ELK/EFK stacks
* Set up alerts, dashboards, and distributed tracing

### 08 – Infrastructure as Code

Automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration:

* **Provisioning:** Terraform (declarative, multi-cloud)
* **Configuration:** Ansible (agentless)

Benefits:

* Version-controlled infrastructure
* Repeatable and auditable deployments
* Team collaboration

### 09 – Scripting Language

Basic programming is essential for automation scripts and small tools. Recommended:

* **Python:** Widely used, easy to learn
* Alternatives: Go, Ruby, Bash, PowerShell

Write utility scripts (cache flush, build triggers) to streamline workflows.

### 10 – Version Control – Git

Git is the foundation of collaboration and automation:

* Core commands: `clone`, `branch`, `merge`, `push`, `pull`
* Branching strategies and pull requests
* Avoid storing secrets in repositories
* Integrate Git with CI/CD pipelines

## Starting From…

Your entry point into DevOps depends on your background:

### Systems Administrator

**You know:** Server administration, networking, security

**To learn:** Developer workflows (Git, Agile), CI/CD fundamentals

### Software Developer

**You know:** Coding, build pipelines, agile practices

**To learn:** Linux/VM administration, cloud infrastructure, networking

### Test Automation Engineer

**You know:** Testing scopes, CI concepts

**To learn:** Linux basics, servers, cloud, containerization

### Network Engineer

**You know:** Networking principles and device configuration

**To learn:** Cloud networking, virtualization, container networking, Kubernetes

### No or Little IT Background

**You need to start with:**

1. Software development lifecycle fundamentals
2. Team collaboration practices (Agile, Git)
3. Basic Linux and server concepts

Then proceed through the full DevOps roadmap with guided tutorials and projects.

## Recap & Resources

### Summary – DevOps Roadmap

1. Cover missing prerequisites based on your background.
2. Learn containers (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
3. Master a cloud provider and automation (CI/CD).
4. Continue learning new tools and practices (IaC, Security as Code).
