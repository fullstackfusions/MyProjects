## five principles for building robust, production-grade ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipelines

The principles are designed to help data engineers reduce the frequency of pipeline failures and improve the overall reliability of their data processes. Here are the key points discussed in the video:

1. **Set Up Failure Alerts**:

- Data pipelines will inevitably fail at some point. It's crucial to set up alerts to notify you of failures through various channels like email, Slack, or Teams. This ensures that you are aware of issues as soon as they occur, preferably before your stakeholders notice.

2. **Add Logs and Exception Handling**:

- Implement logging and exception handling to track the pipeline's steps and identify where and why a failure occurred. Good logs provide insights into the specific steps that failed and the reasons, helping in quicker diagnosis and repair.

3. **Set Up Alerts on Observability Metrics**:

- Observability involves monitoring the health and performance of your data and infrastructure. Set up alerts for key metrics, such as data row counts, upsert metrics, CPU usage, memory usage, and job execution times. This helps in detecting issues even if the failure alert system fails.

4. **Follow Industry Standards and Best Practices**:

- Adhere to industry standards (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) and best practices for the tools and technologies you use. This includes practices like properly importing packages in Apache Airflow. Following these standards helps avoid common pitfalls and leverages community wisdom.

5. **Follow the KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Silly)**:

- Avoid over-engineering your solutions. Keep your code and architecture simple and straightforward. This principle helps ensure that your pipelines are easier to maintain and understand, reducing complexity and potential errors.
