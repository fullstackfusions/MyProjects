**SonarQube** is an open-source platform used for continuous inspection of code quality. It performs automatic reviews of code to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. By using SonarQube, teams can visualize and manage the technical debt of their project, understanding where their codebase stands in terms of quality and what areas need improvement.

**Key features of SonarQube include**:

1. **Multilanguage Support**: SonarQube can analyze and manage code quality across a variety of languages, including Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, C++, and many others.

2. **Code Quality Metrics**: It provides insights on various metrics like code duplication, unit test coverage, complexity, potential bugs, coding standards, and comments.

3. **Integrate with CI/CD**: SonarQube can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, allowing for automatic code quality checks during the build process.

4. **Quality Profiles and Gates**: These are sets of rules that determine how the code analysis is performed. A quality gate is a set of conditions the project must meet before it can be considered as passing. For instance, a condition might be "Coverage on New Code greater than 80%."

5. **Extendable**: SonarQube has a rich ecosystem of plugins to support various programming languages, integrations, and additional checks.

6. **Security Analysis**: Apart from code quality, SonarQube also checks for vulnerabilities and security hotspots in the code.

7. **Historical Data**: It tracks the history of the metrics so that teams can see their progress over time.

**How SonarQube Works**:

1. **Scanning Source Code**: The source code of the project is analyzed by SonarQube scanners. These scanners are typically integrated into CI/CD pipelines, but they can also be run manually.

2. **Sending Results to SonarQube Server**: Once the code is analyzed, the scanner sends the results to the SonarQube server.

3. **Analysis and Storage**: The SonarQube server processes the results, stores them in a database, and updates the project's quality profiles and dashboards.

4. **Visualization**: After analysis, the results are available on the SonarQube dashboard, where teams can view issues, technical debt, code coverage, and more.

5. **Review and Action**: Developers can review the issues flagged by SonarQube, understand their severity, and take necessary action. They can also set up notifications to be alerted on new issues.

6. **Integration with IDEs**: Developers can use plugins (like SonarLint) in their IDEs to get real-time feedback on code quality while they are coding.

By integrating SonarQube into the development lifecycle, teams can ensure that code quality is consistently monitored and maintained, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and more reliable software.
