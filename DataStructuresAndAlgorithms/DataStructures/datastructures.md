When it comes to data structures, here are the key areas to focus on:

1. **Fundamental Data Structures**: Master the basics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary, AVL, B-tree), graphs, heaps, hash tables, and tries. These are essential in understanding how data can be stored, accessed, and manipulated efficiently.

2. **Advanced Data Structures**: Look into more complex structures like segment trees, Fenwick trees (for range queries), and suffix trees/arrays for string processing. These are useful in specialized contexts like data analysis, game development, and competitive programming.

3. **Algorithms with Data Structures**: Study algorithms for sorting, searching, traversal, and graph-based approaches like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, and Kruskal's algorithms. Learning to pair algorithms with appropriate data structures is critical for solving real-world problems.

4. **Data Structure Complexity**: Understanding the time and space complexity of each data structure is key for evaluating their efficiency, especially as you scale data volumes.

5. **Use Cases**: Try to understand real-world applications of each data structure. This builds intuition on when and why to use a particular structure in practical scenarios.

As for learning data structures in all languages or just Python, learning them deeply in Python should be sufficient initially. The core principles and functionality of data structures are the same across languages. Once you're comfortable, you can then adapt these skills to other languages as needed, which is relatively easy once the foundational knowledge is strong.
