    "Analyzing the time complexity of common loop patterns is fundamental in understanding how algorithms scale with the size of their inputs. Below are code examples of various loop structures and their respective time complexity analyses, covering simple loops, nested loops, and loops with different increments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Single Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A single loop that iterates over an array or a range of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def single_loop(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        print(i)  # Example operation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Analysis: The loop runs `n` times, so the time complexity is linear, **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Nested Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop inside another loop, often used to work with multidimensional data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def nested_loops(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        for j in range(n):\n",
    "            print(i, j)  # Example operation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexity: O(n^2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Analysis: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs `n` times, resulting in `n * n` operations, hence the quadratic time complexity, **O(n^2)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Loop with Constant Increment\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop that increments by a constant greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def loop_constant_increment(n):\n",
    "    i = 0\n",
    "    while i < n:\n",
    "        print(i)  # Example operation\n",
    "        i += 2  # Increment by 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexity: O(n/2) ≈ O(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Analysis: Despite the increment of 2, the time complexity is still linear. We simplify **O(n/2)** to **O(n)**, as constants are dropped in Big O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Loop with Variable Increment\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop that doubles its counter on each iteration, often seen in divide-and-conquer algorithms or when halving a search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def loop_variable_increment(n):\n",
    "    i = 1\n",
    "    while i < n:\n",
    "        print(i)  # Example operation\n",
    "        i *= 2  # Double i\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexity: O(log n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Analysis: The loop counter doubles each time, so the number of iterations needed grows logarithmically with `n`. Thus, the time complexity is **O(log n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Nested Loops with Dependent Iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested loops where the inner loop's range depends on the outer loop's current value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def nested_loops_dependent_iterations(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        for j in range(i + 1):  # Depends on i\n",
    "            print(i, j)  # Example operation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexity: O(n(n+1)/2) ≈ O(n^2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Analysis: The number of total iterations is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is **n(n+1)/2**. This simplifies to **O(n^2)**, indicating quadratic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Loop**: Linear growth, **O(n)**.\n",
    "- **Nested Loops**: Quadratic growth, **O(n^2)**, typical for operations on every pair of elements in an array.\n",
    "- **Loop with Constant Increment**: Linear growth, **O(n)**, where the increment affects the constant factor but not the overall growth rate.\n",
    "- **Loop with Variable Increment**: Logarithmic growth, **O(log n)**, efficient for operations that can halve the problem size with each step.\n",
    "- **Nested Loops with Dependent Iterations**: Quadratic growth, **O(n^2)**, although the exact number of iterations might be less than **n^2**, the overall trend is quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these patterns is key to analyzing algorithms and estimating their performance and scalability."
