    "## Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, used for organizing data in a particular order to optimize searching and processing tasks. Each algorithm has its own set of advantages and drawbacks, making them suitable for different scenarios based on the size of the data, the distribution of the data elements, and the computational complexity requirements. Here's an overview of various sorting algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bubble Sort\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Average and worst-case time complexity is \\(O(n^2)\\), making it inefficient for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Useful for small datasets or nearly sorted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Selection Sort\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Selects the minimum element from the unsorted segment of the array and swaps it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted segment.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Always \\(O(n^2)\\) for comparisons, regardless of the initial order of the data.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Simple to implement but inefficient for large datasets, similar to bubble sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Insertion Sort\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each new element into its proper place among the previously sorted elements.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: \\(O(n^2)\\) in the average and worst case, but efficient for small data sets or nearly sorted data.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Efficient for small datasets, online sorting, and as part of more complex algorithms like shell sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Merge Sort\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: \\(O(n \\log n)\\) in all cases, which is optimal for comparison-based sorting.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Efficient for large datasets, stable sort, and used in external sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Quick Sort\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot, sorting the partitions recursively.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Average case \\(O(n \\log n)\\), but worst-case is \\(O(n^2)\\). However, with good pivot selection strategies, the worst-case is rare.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Preferred for large datasets, especially with in-memory sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Heap Sort\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Utilizes a binary heap data structure to sort the elements. It builds a max heap from the data and repeatedly removes the maximum element from the heap, rebuilding the heap each time.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: \\(O(n \\log n)\\) in all cases.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Efficient for large datasets, not stable but does not require additional memory for merge operations like merge sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Counting Sort\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Counts the occurrences of each unique element, then calculates the position of each element.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: \\(O(n + k)\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of elements and \\(k\\) is the range of the input.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Efficient for sorting integers when the range of potential items (k) is not significantly greater than the number of items (n).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Radix Sort\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Sorts the numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit, using a stable sort (like counting sort) as an intermediate sort.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: \\(O(nk)\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of elements and \\(k\\) is the number of digits in the largest number.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Useful for sorting large sets of numbers, where the numbers are not too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Shell Sort\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: An optimization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart by using a gap sequence to determine which elements to compare and move.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Varies between \\(O(n)\\) and \\(O(n^2)\\) depending on the gap sequence used, with some sequences achieving \\(O(n^{1.5})\\).\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: More efficient than insertion sort for medium-sized datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Choosing the right sorting algorithm depends on the specifics of your data and requirements. For large datasets, algorithms like merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort are generally preferred due to their \\(O(n \\log n)\\) efficiency. For smaller datasets or nearly sorted data, insertion sort or shell sort might be more appropriate. Counting sort, radix sort, and bucket sort are excellent choices for sorting integers within a specific range, offering linear time complexity under certain conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Search Algorithms\n",
    "Search algorithms are designed to retrieve information stored within some data structure or computed in the search space of a problem domain. The efficiency of a search algorithm is determined by how quickly it can find an item or verify its absence in a collection.

    "\n",
    "### 2. Binary Search\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: In a sorted array, it repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half, otherwise to the upper half.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: \\(O(\\log n)\\), significantly faster for sorted data than a linear search.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Searching in sorted arrays or ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Jump Search\n",

    "- **Use Cases**: Efficient for uniformly distributed, sorted datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Exponential Search\n",

    "- **Use Cases**: Traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, finding connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level, utilizing a queue.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: \\(O(V + E)\\), similar to DFS.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs, level order traversal of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Ternary Search\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Similar to binary search but divides the array into three parts using two midpoints and recursively searches in the appropriate part.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: \\(O(\\log_3 n)\\), but has more comparisons in practice than binary search.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Searching in sorted arrays where the overhead of two midpoints is offset by other factors (rarely used in practice).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Hash Table Search\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) on average for search, insert, and delete operations, but can degrade to \\(O(n)\\) in the worst case when all keys hash to the same index.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Efficient lookup operations, implementing associative arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The choice of a search algorithm depends on the structure of the data (e.g., sorted vs. unsorted, tree, graph), the properties of the data (e.g., distribution), and the performance requirements of the application. For sorted arrays, binary search offers a significant improvement over linear search. For tree and graph data structures, DFS and BFS are more suitable. Hash tables provide a way to achieve constant-time search complexity in scenarios where direct access is feasible.\n",

However, they may not always provide the most optimal solution for all problem types. Understanding when and how to apply greedy algorithms is key to leveraging their efficiency in solving optimization problems.\n",

These problems have applications in a wide range of fields, from telecommunications to transportation and beyond. Here are several key algorithms used for solving different types of network flow problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Computes the maximum flow from a source to a sink in a flow network.\n",

    "- **Purpose**: Finds the maximum flow in a network with the minimum possible cost. This is crucial for problems where each edge has a capacity as well as a cost associated with transporting the flow.\n",
