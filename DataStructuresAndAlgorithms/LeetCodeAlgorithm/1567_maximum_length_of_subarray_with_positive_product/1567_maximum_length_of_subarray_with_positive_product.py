'''As we traverse through nums, we keep a running size/length of positive and negative products, represented by pos and neg, respectively

The logic is as follows:
if current element is positive then
-positive will be the previous positive length + 1 (because positive x positive = positive)
-negative will be the previous negative length + 1 (because positive x negative = negative and only if a negative product length exists, otherwise its zero)
if current element is negative then
-positive will be the previous negative length + 1 (because negative x negative = positive but only if a neg exists, otherwise its zero)
-negative will be the previous positive length + 1 (because positive x negative = negative)
if current element is zero then
-reset all lengths to zero

The questions is concerned with the maximum length subarray of positive products, so we only use this to update ans.'''
