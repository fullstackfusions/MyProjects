Below is a concise comparison between a RESTful API and an “XML API” (often implemented via SOAP or custom XML-over-HTTP). Think of REST as an architectural style rather than a specific format, whereas an XML API is defined by its use of XML for request/response payloads.

---

## 1. Definitions

* **REST API**

  * An architectural style that treats every resource as a URL (endpoint).
  * Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
  * Payloads can be in JSON, XML, YAML, or any format the server/client agree upon—JSON is most common today.

* **XML API**

  * Any API that strictly uses XML as its data interchange format.
  * Often implemented via SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) or a custom XML-over-HTTP scheme.
  * Requests and responses are wrapped in XML envelopes, with specific schemas/WSDL in SOAP’s case.

## 2. Data Format

| Aspect             | REST API                                    | XML API                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Payload format     | Typically JSON (but can be XML, YAML, etc.) | Always XML (e.g. SOAP envelopes or custom XML) |
| Verbosity          | JSON is more compact; XML is more verbose   | Generally more verbose (opening/closing tags)  |
| Schema enforcement | Optional (can use JSON Schema)              | Strict XML Schema (XSD) or WSDL in SOAP        |

---

## 3. Protocol & Envelope

* **REST API**

  * Directly maps HTTP methods to CRUD operations on “resources.”
  * No mandatory envelope or wrapper—payload = the actual resource representation.
  * Uses standard HTTP response codes (200, 201, 404, 500, etc.).

* **XML API (SOAP)**

  * Uses a predefined XML envelope (SOAP Envelope, Header, Body) for every request/response.
  * Relies on WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for service definitions, operations, and message structure.
  * Uses its own set of SOAP fault codes inside the XML body (in addition to HTTP status).

---

## 4. Coupling & Discoverability

* **REST API**

  * Loosely coupled. The client only needs to know endpoint URLs and expected JSON/XML structure.
  * Often “self-describing” through HATEOAS (hypermedia links), but in practice documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) is used.

* **XML API (SOAP)**

  * More tightly coupled. Client typically generates stubs from WSDL so it “knows” the exact envelope and data types.
  * WSDL provides machine-readable contract (operations, data types, namespaces).

---

## 5. Performance & Overhead

* **REST API**

  * JSON payloads tend to be smaller (less parsing overhead).
  * No mandatory envelope: payload size is usually lower.
  * Simpler parsing on client side (especially in JavaScript/Python with built-in JSON parsers).

* **XML API (SOAP)**

  * XML’s verbosity increases payload size.
  * XML parsing can be slower than JSON parsing in many environments.
  * Additional SOAP headers (security, transactions) add overhead.

---

## 6. Error Handling

* **REST API**

  * Uses HTTP status codes (4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors).
  * Error details often returned in a simple JSON or XML object (e.g., `{ "error": "Not found", "code": 404 }`).

* **XML API (SOAP)**

  * Always returns a `<SOAP-ENV:Fault>` element in the response body when something goes wrong.
  * Fault structure is standardized (faultcode, faultstring, detail).

---

## 7. Tooling & Ecosystem

* **REST API**

  * Nearly every modern language/framework has first-class support (e.g., Flask/Django/FastAPI in Python, Express/NestJS in Node, Spring Boot in Java).
  * Auto-generated docs via OpenAPI/Swagger.
  * Client libraries often hand-rolled or generated from OpenAPI specs.

* **XML API (SOAP)**

  * Established in enterprise environments (Java EE, .NET, etc.).
  * Tools generate client/server stubs from WSDL (e.g., `wsimport` in Java, `Add Service Reference` in .NET).
  * Built-in support for advanced WS-\* standards (WS-Security, WS-Transactions, WS-ReliableMessaging).

---

## 8. When to Choose Which

* **Choose REST** when:

  1. You want a lightweight, stateless service.
  2. You prefer JSON for data interchange (easier for web/UIs).
  3. You don’t need strict SOAP contracts or enterprise-level WS-\* features.

* **Choose an XML API/SOAP** when:

  1. You must interoperate with existing SOAP-based systems or strict XML schemas.
  2. You need built-in WS-Security, transactions, or reliable messaging.
  3. Your organization mandates WSDL contracts for client-server generation.

### Example Comparison Snippet

**REST (JSON)**

```
GET /api/orders/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Accept: application/json

⟶ Response 200 OK
{
  "orderId": 123,
  "status": "SHIPPED",
  "items": [ { "sku": "ABC", "qty": 2 } ]
}
```

**XML API (SOAP)**

```
POST /soap/OrderService HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: text/xml

<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ord="http://example.com/order">
  <soapenv:Header/>
  <soapenv:Body>
    <ord:GetOrderRequest>
      <ord:OrderID>123</ord:OrderID>
    </ord:GetOrderRequest>
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>

⟶ Response 200 OK
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ord="http://example.com/order">
  <soapenv:Header/>
  <soapenv:Body>
    <ord:GetOrderResponse>
      <ord:OrderID>123</ord:OrderID>
      <ord:Status>SHIPPED</ord:Status>
      <ord:Items>
        <ord:Item>
          <ord:SKU>ABC</ord:SKU>
          <ord:Qty>2</ord:Qty>
        </ord:Item>
      </ord:Items>
    </ord:GetOrderResponse>
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

### Summary

1. **REST** is a style that can use XML or JSON (JSON being most common). It emphasizes resources, statelessness, and uses HTTP verbs directly.
2. **XML API** (often SOAP) strictly uses XML envelopes and WSDL contracts, offering more rigid schemas and built-in enterprise features at the cost of extra verbosity.

Use this comparison to decide whether you need a lightweight, JSON-friendly, resource-oriented REST approach or a formal, contract-driven XML/SOAP service.
