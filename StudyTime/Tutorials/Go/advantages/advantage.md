## Execution and Compilation Speed
- Go is faster than interpreted languages like Python, Ruby, etc
- Go is faster than compiled languages like C, C++, C#, Java

## Memory Management in GO
- Unlike Rust or C langauge Go language has automatic memory management
- Similar Java, Go lanaguge has automatic memory management

## Resources to run Go
- Java has JVM to compile and run the code which uses so much resources.
- Go language has very light weight compiler so it doesn't use much resources to compile and run the code.
- so at the end it will use resources efficiently just like C/Rust.
