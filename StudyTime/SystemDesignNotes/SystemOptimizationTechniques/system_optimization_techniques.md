Differentiating between I/O-bound, CPU-bound, and memory-bound tasks is essential for optimizing the use of concurrency, parallelism, and system resources. Here’s a breakdown of these types of tasks, along with key indicators:

### 1. **I/O-Bound Tasks**

- **Definition**: Tasks that spend most of their time waiting for input/output operations, such as network requests, disk reads/writes, or database queries.
- **Indicators**:
  - High wait times on network or disk I/O (e.g., API requests, file reads).
  - Task time is largely spent waiting for external resources or processes to complete.
- **Optimization**:
  - Use asynchronous programming (`asyncio`, `async/await` in Python) to allow other tasks to proceed during I/O waits.
  - Multithreading can be effective as threads can wait independently for I/O without blocking the main thread.
- **Examples**:

  - Web scraping or HTTP requests.
