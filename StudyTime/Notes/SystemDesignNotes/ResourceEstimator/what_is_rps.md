# What is RPS?

A Resource Planning System (RPS) enables the demand-oriented planning of personnel deployment in a company. For this purpose, an RPS addresses the question of which resources are required to what extent in order to fulfil an order, usually within a specified time frame. Based on the processes, the order load as well as the available personnel, the RPS optimises the personnel deployment considering qualitative and quantitative employee capacities. The inclusion of risk factors, such as the unavailability of employees or an unforeseeable high order volume, is also relevant in this context. In addition, vacancies caused by holidays or public holidays as well as on the basis of regular working hours can be considered by the RPS during planning as well.

By determining and visualising suitable key figures, the RPS also supports order-related optimisation of the resources used and enables flexible reactions to potential risk factors.

An RPS not only takes over the short-term planning of personnel deployment and ensures transparency regarding the utilisation and availability of individual resources, but can also support long-term planning and individual employee development. Thus, for example, the further training of employees can be coordinated or, by mapping schedules, the calculation of deadlines in connection with the dispatched capacities can be enabled.

**One of the incident from Jio Cinema Live stream**
Was We Have Three Stacks on CDNs Right We Have Your Video Stack You Have Your API Stack And Then You Have Your Image Stack Now A couple of days into the IPL we are all monitoring our video and API stack and one of our CDN partners said here something wrong Going On Your Image Stack And It Has touched 90 CPU And We Were all really Confused We're Like Images Is Really Just Static Delivery Like What Could Be Going There And If Images Goes Down there's Literally Nothing Left on Our Page Because You Open the Home Page We Just Have Movie Posters
And Show Posters We Don't Have Any Text So That Was Really Like A P0 Sort Of Incident For Us What We Did During That's the time we went and saw the traffic on our CDN for the image requests and We see that there was a set of 30 to 50 images that are doing 10 million rps on a CDN And We're Like OK What Are These Images And We Release That We Had Found This feature These are called stars where you go to the playback page and you see stars of your favorite Teams and Your Favorite Cricketers and there are 50 stickers on Game That One
Customer Request Was Translating to 50 Images Being Downloaded from the CDN and That Was Just Like Birding Our CDN Right So What We Did First Step Judge
Mitigation was that we said OK we can increase the detail of two images so that people have received it once when they come back it's loaded from the device cases and dozen really and up coming to CDN that help us a bit but then again we have a lot of new people that come on the platform right so what we did was we're like okay we have two option one is you do sprite and the second thing is you do base64 and luckily because the images are shareable on the stars we already had base64 coded versions of this present so we bundled them together and sent to Clients in One Single API Call That Gets Our RPS From Like 10 Million RPS to 100K RPS So That's a Lot of Tuning That You Need to Do at CDN Edge
