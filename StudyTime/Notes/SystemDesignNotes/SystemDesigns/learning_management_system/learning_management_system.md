An LMS is a great project that will gimme room to implement a lot of core backend concepts: beside the obvious ones: Framework, Database, Authentication I can also implement a lot of other cool things like: splitting it into separate micro-services, implementing a messaging queue so the system is more robust and less coupled and a lot of other technical requirements.

The requirement of the (LMS) I wanna build are as follows:

## 1. User Roles

### 1.1 Admin

- Can manage user accounts, courses, and system settings.
- Has access to all features and functionalities of the LMS.

### 1.2 Teacher

- Can create, manage, and publish courses.
- Has access to a dashboard for course management and analytics.

### 1.3 Student

- Can enroll in courses, view course content, and track progress.
- Has access to a dashboard for viewing enrolled courses and progress.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Course Management

- Teachers can create and manage courses, including adding modules, lessons, quizzes, and assignments.
- Course content can include text, images, videos, presentations, and other multimedia elements.
- Teachers can set prerequisites, deadlines, and grading criteria for courses.

### 2.2 Student Enrollment

- Students can browse the course marketplace and enroll in courses.
- Enrollment process includes payment integration for paid courses.
- Students receive notifications and updates on enrolled courses.

### 2.3 Dashboards

Teacher Dashboard:

- Overview of course analytics, including enrollment, completion rates, and student performance.
- Tools for managing course content, assignments, and communication with students.
  Student Dashboard:
- List of enrolled courses with progress tracking.
- Access to course materials, assignments, and grades.

### 2.4 Communication

- Integrated messaging system for communication between teachers and students.
- Discussion forums for course-specific discussions and peer interaction.
- Announcements and notifications for important updates and deadlines.

### 2.5 Assessment and Grading

- Support for various assessment formats, including quizzes, assignments, and exams.
- Automatic grading for objective assessments and manual grading for subjective assessments.
- Gradebook for teachers to track student performance and provide feedback.

### 2.6 Course Marketplace

- Platform for course creators to publish and sell their courses.
- Course discovery features, including search, filters, and recommendations.
- Revenue sharing model for course creators and platform fees for transactions.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Frontend

- which is the thing that it is not my priority for now, I'll focus on implementing a big part if not all the backend logic before I think of the front end

### 3.2 Backend

- Scalable and secure backend infrastructure hosted on cloud service.
- RESTful, gRPC, websockets, GraphQL APIs (maybe only restfull, maybe two of them maybe all I'm not sure yet) for communication between frontend and backend components.
- Micro-services architecture where each part of the bakcend system will have each own containerized independent service
- Integration with third party services (payment gateways and storage buckets, ...)

### 3.3 Database

- Relational database management system is must for such big system with tones of related entities.
- May NoSQL database for storing more instructed data like courses content and chapters......
- An in-memory data base for caching purposes.

## 4. Security and Compliance

### 4.1 User Authentication

- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for user accounts.
- Support for OAuth2 providers like google, github....

### 4.2 Data Protection

- Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### 4.3 Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive features and functionalities.
- Granular permissions management for admins, teachers, and students.

Just for project purpose:

### Backend Framework:

**NestJS**: Main backend framework, providing a modular and scalable architecture for building server-side applications with TypeScript.

### Database:

**PostgreSQL**: Main relational database management system (RDBMS) used for storing and managing structured data in the project.

### Programming Language:

**TypeScript**: Language of choice enforced by NestJS, offering strong typing and modern features for enhanced developer productivity and code maintainability.

### Message Broker:

**RabbitMQ**: Messaging broker utilized for asynchronous communication and event-driven architecture, facilitating scalable and decoupled backend services.

### Cloud Hosting Provider:

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Cloud infrastructure platform used for hosting, deploying, and scaling the project's backend services and resources.

### Payment Integration:

**Stripe**: Payment processing platform integrated into the project for handling online payments securely and efficiently.

### Object Storage:

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Scalable cloud storage solution employed for storing and retrieving large files and media assets in the project.

### Caching:

**Redis**: In-memory data store utilized for caching frequently accessed data and improving the performance and responsiveness of the application.

### Containerization:

**Docker**: Containerization platform employed for packaging the project's applications and dependencies into lightweight and portable containers.

### Container Orchestration:

**Kubernetes (K8s)**: Container orchestration tool utilized for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications in a clustered environment.
