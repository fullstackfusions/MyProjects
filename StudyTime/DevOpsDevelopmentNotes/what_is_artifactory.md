Artifactory is a product by JFrog that acts as a universal artifact repository manager. An artifact, in the context of software development, is a byproduct produced during the software development process, which can be a source code, libraries, documentation, executables, binary modules, and other such related things.

Here are the primary purposes and advantages of using Artifactory:

1. **Centralized Repository**: Artifactory provides a centralized hub where teams can store and manage binaries, ensuring consistent access to artifacts.

2. **Integration with Build Tools**: Artifactory seamlessly integrates with popular build tools and package managers like Maven, Gradle, NPM, NuGet, Docker, and many more, making it easier to fetch and manage dependencies.

3. **Traceability**: With Artifactory, every build artifact is stored along with exhaustive build information, allowing full traceability of your builds.

4. **Security**: It provides fine-grained access control to your artifacts, ensuring that only authorized individuals or systems can access specific artifacts.

5. **Replication**: For organizations that have development teams distributed across the globe, Artifactory allows local repositories to be replicated to remote locations.

6. **Cache Remote Artifacts**: Artifactory can cache remote artifacts, so if an external repository goes down or if you want to limit external requests, your builds wonâ€™t be affected.

7. **Metadata**: Along with the actual artifacts, Artifactory stores metadata, enhancing search capabilities and providing more information about stored binaries.

8. **Optimized Storage**: Artifactory uses checksum-based storage, which ensures that the same artifact isn't stored multiple times, reducing storage needs.

9. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Artifactory easily integrates with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools, streamlining the process of moving from source code to deployment.

10. **Disaster Recovery**: It offers ways to backup and recover artifacts, ensuring your organization can handle system failures or other catastrophic events.

In a nutshell, Artifactory addresses the complexity of managing software libraries, binary artifacts, and their accompanying metadata, especially in a microservices architecture, CI/CD pipelines, or when dealing with multiple software ecosystems. Having a single, central location to manage these artifacts can significantly simplify build processes, dependency management, and deployment strategies.
